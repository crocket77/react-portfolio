      <h1 id="about">Who am I?</h1>
      <p>I am an individual that cares about helping the world be a better place through philanthropy and bringing people to their true selves.
      After graduating highschool I started out at Texas State University wanting to be in sports science because I loved athletics and was an accomplished wrestler on my highschool wrestling team.
      I also discovered a passion and started training and breaking horses that year and soon switched to Ag business management with the dream of one day owning a ranch where I could train horses.
      Although I became very good with horses and loved the economic aspects of what I was learning I soon realized that I was enjoying my math classes more than my other classes.
      I switched into manufacturing engineering and one day had my life changed by a documentary called "Gasland". It was about fracking and the atrocities, for lack of a better term, that oil and gas companies were committing accross the United States.
      This lead me to want to work towards renewable energy and fight these oil and gas companies. I got involved with a professor that was working with graphene, a two dimensional carbon material and I also joined an organization called the Human Environmental Animal Team or HEAT, for short, where I became an environmental committee director.
      It was great but I started to ask myself questions about what is the greatest organization that serves mankind. From the environmental committee I came to realize that the environment was contingent on the humans who lived on it and the animals that were a part of its ecosystem. 
      I started to search my faith as well during this time as I was experiencing prophetic dreams of events. Coming to understand that these were not easily explained by science I began to search my faith. Jesus has always been a part of my life but I was not active in prayer or going to church.
      I would go to anything faith related considering all faiths from Buddhism to Islam to the many forms of Christianity. One day I realized that I had not been going to the Catholic church where my father would take me from a very young age. I decided that I needed to give it the fair chance that I was giving everything else.
      A priest gave a homily during the first church service I went to stating that "The Catholic Church is the largest oldest service organization in the world. Doing more good in a single day than any other service organization will do in its entire existence." This was a strong realization for me.
      I continued doing research and being a part of HEAT but making the Catholic Church a better church became a mission of mine. I graduated from College with a Manufacturing Engineering and Applied Mathematics double major and continued doing research after. I came up with an idea for making a transparent conductor metal mesh and method for creating a nano sized gap
      that could be used for DNA sequencing. I went out and got those ideas patented but soon lost my passion for the world of research and its difficulties. I went into automation and PLC programming for a profession and still in the field to this day. I have been working towards becoming a capable full stack developer. I am active in my church by singing in the choir, 
      being a youth leader volunteer, recorder for the knights of columbus mens service fraternity, and helping out with other parish activities. My goal is to help people as best I can. A quote from Jesus that I take to heart is that "the greatest among us are the ones who serve", and that is how I try to live my life as it is an ambition to be the greatest I can be.
