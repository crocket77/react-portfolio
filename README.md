For deploying REACT to github
At the command-line prompt, navigate to the project's root directory and install gh-pages as a devDependency, using the following command:
npm install -D gh-pages

Next, modify the package.json file to include the homepage property at the top. This is where the website will be deployed. Use your GitHub username in place of the <username> placeholder, and repository in place of <repository>:
"homepage": "http://<username>.github.io/<repostiory>",
